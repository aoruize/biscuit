# Typecheck After Changes

After making substantive code changes (new files, changed imports, new/updated props or interfaces, added dependencies), run:

```bash
bun run typecheck
```

This runs `tsc --noEmit` against the app config and catches errors that `ReadLints` may miss — especially invalid named imports from barrel re-exports in `node_modules`.

- If it reports errors, fix them before completing the task.
- Use `ReadLints` for quick inline feedback during edits, and `bun run typecheck` as a final verification before finishing.
